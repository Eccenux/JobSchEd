 Done
-----------------------
* parse code to internal structures
* render wikicode from internal structures
** oJobSchEd.buildWikicode
** oJobSchEd.buildTaskcode
* Basic add task dialog
* Add missing labels
* More acurate names for methods
* Fix for select inputs (values were not updated)
* Task class? Could use something like new this.oTask() and some methods might be moved...;
** Not really working... Moving oTask idea to cJobSchEdTask prototype.
** Moved methods to different files for easier editing...
** <del>Change current usage of loose objects to class instances usage</del> - not really needed...
** Some cleanup

-----------------------
 TODO
-----------------------
* Dialog with a list of all persons.
* Dialog with a list of all tasks of a person.
* Edit dialog based on add dialog.
* Add person dialog based on add task dialog.
* Linking everything as on original mockups.
* Delete task method.
* Delete person method.

-----------------------
 Someday...
-----------------------
* Use the loader or simply combain "modules" into one file...
** Own loader would:
*** remove inline comments without removing any whitespace (might be troublesome... e.g. "djfhjshd // test").
*** remove multiline comments but adding an inline comment with the original line number of the end of the comment ("// EOC@line#X").
*** add an inline comment with the original file name at the begging ("// FileName.js, line#0") and the end of the file ("// FileName.js, EOF").
*** add modified files to a single file
*** check if any of the files was modified and serve cached file if not (mod check by cached file date)

-----------------------
THE LOADER CHECK:
-----------------------
	var z = ""+
		"djfhjshd // test"
	;
	var x = /a"aa\/\/a"sa/ " \
	//\
	";
	var x = /aaa*/;
