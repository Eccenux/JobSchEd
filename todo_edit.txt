 Done
-----------------------
* parse code to internal structures
* render wikicode from internal structures
** oJobSchEd.buildWikicode
** oJobSchEd.buildTaskcode
* Basic add task dialog
* Add missing labels
* More accurate names for methods
* Fix for select inputs (values were not updated)
* Task class? Could use something like new this.oTask() and some methods might be moved...;
** Not really working... Moving oTask idea to cJobSchEdTask prototype.
** Moved methods to different files for easier editing...
** <del>Change current usage of loose objects to class instances usage</del> - not really needed...
** Some clean up
* Dialogue with a list of all persons.
* Dialogue with a list of all tasks of a person.
* Move dialogues to subobjects.
* Refresh methods for dialogues (run after add/edit).
* Common from Add moved out...
* Edit dialogue based on add dialogue.
* Support changing persons in edit dialogue.
* Add person dialogue based on add task dialogue.
* Edit person dialogue.
* Reposition clean up (needs new version of sftJSmsg to work as planned)
* Look&feel more like on original mockups (+images).
* Delete task methods.
* Delete person methods.
* Refresh of fields problem (they are filled with previous values upon add => out of sync with oNewTask => unexpected)

-----------------------
 TODO
-----------------------
* Use the loader or simply combine "modules" into one file...
** Own loader would:
*** remove in-line comments without removing any whitespace (might be troublesome... e.g. "djfhjshd // test").
*** remove multi-line comments but adding an in-line comment with the original line number of the end of the comment ("// EOC@line#X").
*** add an in-line comment with the original file name at the begging ("// FileName.js, line#0") and the end of the file ("// FileName.js, EOF").
*** add modified files to a single file
*** check if any of the files was modified and serve cached file if not (mod check by cached file date)
*** "FileName" shown in the combined file as not a real name (rather a name of a module)

-----------------------
 Someday...
-----------------------
* Sort task by start date upon build/on demand?
* Person select set to read-only?

-----------------------
THE LOADER CHECK:
-----------------------
	var z = ""+
		"djfhjshd // test"
	;
	var x = /a"aa\/\/asa/ " \
	//\
	";
	var x = /aa\/*a*/;
